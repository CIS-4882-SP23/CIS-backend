Heres how you run this stuff. Make sure you got nodeJS and npm installed (Luis don't fucking use `apt-get` i swear to god)

Clone the repo, use WSL2 or Linux or macOS. If you try and get this shit working natively on windows, you're on your own. Fuck windows.

Inside the repo folder, again using a command line terminal, run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

Next, just run `npm run start:dev`.

The API should be up at `http://localhost:3000`

You can view the "API documentation" at `http://localhost:3000/api`

If it doesnt work, just google the error and don't fuck up the repo kthnxbye
